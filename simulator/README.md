# Simulator

The simulator project should enable you to iterate and test your code faster.
It provides certain basic libraries that are used by the tiny screen library 
and the arduino projects are compiled against these.

It's using GLFW 3 for displaying the TinyScreen's content. 

The code is in a very very shameful state as it grew from a prove of concept 
codebase. As it already does everything that's needed, I am not sure if that'll ever change.
