# TinyDuino 2 Play Lib

This is my 2nd library for the TinyDuino that is specifically targeting
the TinyScreen+ which is a much more potent processor with more RAM and
processing power.

This project is still in a very early stage!

## Project structure

* ./srclib: The library files (headers) to be included in the arduino files
* ./arduino: The arduino projects to test with
* ./simulator: A simple simulator that enables compilation on PC for testing
* ./screenshots: A collection of screenshots I'm making over the course of development
* ./tools: Tools that may be used during development
* ./pagebufferscript: A scripting language for TD environment - concept only so far

For more information, please read the readme files in the respective directories.
