# Arduino projects

The subdirectories in this path contain arduino IDE ready projects.

Before you can compile them, you'll have to copy the header files from 
../srclib to the project that you want to compile. Alternatively you can
execute the shell script that does this automatically for you.

Make sure you update the header files after an update. And don't edit
individual headers in the project files. Changes will be lost!

The ./test directory contains a test project for testing particular
features during development.
